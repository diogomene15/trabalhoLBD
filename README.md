# trabalhoLBD - NutriSafe
Welcome. This is a simple college project that uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) to build a system called **NutriSafe**.

## How to depoloy it?
The easiest way for running it up is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/):
```bash
docker-compose up . -d
```
